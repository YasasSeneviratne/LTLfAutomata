To run experiments:

1. Combine patterns into larger formulas with the combine_rules.sh script.
This script generates a set of formulas by combining patterns with conjunctions or disjunctions (parameter in the script).

2a. Generate ANML (discrete) automata with the make-anml-from-rules.sh script.
This script iterates through each generated formula and generates a DFA (ANML) and NFA (RANML) for each formula.

2b. Generate Transition Table (symbolic) automata with the make-tt-from-rules.sh script.
This script iterates through each generated formula and generates a DFA (tt) and NFA (rtt) for each formula.

3. Generate Hardware in the form of Verilog Hardware Description Language with the Generate_Hardware.sh script.
This script iterates through each generated ANML, RANML, TT, and RTT directory and generates Verilog for each with the help of Grapefruit.

4. Deploy Hardware to the AWS cloud with the deploy-hardware.sh script.
This script zips up all of the generated Verilog and sends it to AWS instances where it can be compiled in parallel.
