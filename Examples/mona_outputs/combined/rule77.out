ANALYSIS
A counter-example of least length (1) is:
I4              X 0
I5              X X
I9              X 0
I6              X 0

I4 = {}
I5 = {}
I9 = {}
I6 = {}

A satisfying example of least length (1) is:
I4              X 0
I5              X X
I9              X 1
I6              X 0

I4 = {}
I5 = {}
I9 = {0}
I6 = {}
