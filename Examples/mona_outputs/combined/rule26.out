ANALYSIS
A counter-example of least length (1) is:
I1              X 0
I7              X 0
I4              X 0
I9              X 1

I1 = {}
I7 = {}
I4 = {}
I9 = {0}

A satisfying example of least length (1) is:
I1              X 0
I7              X 0
I4              X 0
I9              X 0

I1 = {}
I7 = {}
I4 = {}
I9 = {}
