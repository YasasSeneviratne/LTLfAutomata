ANALYSIS
A counter-example of least length (1) is:
I1              X 0
I8              X 0
I3              X X
I9              X 1
I6              X X

I1 = {}
I8 = {}
I3 = {}
I9 = {0}
I6 = {}

A satisfying example of least length (1) is:
I1              X 0
I8              X 0
I3              X X
I9              X 0
I6              X X

I1 = {}
I8 = {}
I3 = {}
I9 = {}
I6 = {}
