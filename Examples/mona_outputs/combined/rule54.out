ANALYSIS
A counter-example of least length (1) is:
I7              X X
I4              X 0
I2              X 0
I1              X 0

I7 = {}
I4 = {}
I2 = {}
I1 = {}

A satisfying example of least length (1) is:
I7              X X
I4              X 0
I2              X 1
I1              X 0

I7 = {}
I4 = {}
I2 = {0}
I1 = {}
