ANALYSIS
A counter-example of least length (1) is:
I1              X 0
I0              X 0
I4              X 1
I8              X 1
I9              X X

I1 = {}
I0 = {}
I4 = {0}
I8 = {0}
I9 = {}

A satisfying example of least length (1) is:

I4              X 0
I8              X X
I9              X X

I1 = {}
I0 = {}
I4 = {}
I8 = {}
