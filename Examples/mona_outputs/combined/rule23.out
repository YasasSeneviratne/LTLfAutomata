ANALYSIS
A counter-example of least length (1) is:
I7              X 0
I4              X 0
I8              X X
I5              X 0
I6              X 0

I7 = {}
I4 = {}
I8 = {}
I5 = {}
I6 = {}

A satisfying example of least length (1) is:
I7              X 0
I4              X 0
I8              X X
I5              X 0
I6              X 1

I7 = {}
I4 = {}
I8 = {}
I5 = {}
I6 = {0}
