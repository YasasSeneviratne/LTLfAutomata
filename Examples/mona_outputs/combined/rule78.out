ANALYSIS
A counter-example of least length (1) is:
I7              X 0
I0              X 0
I3              X X
I2              X 0
I1              X 1

I7 = {}
I0 = {}
I3 = {}
I2 = {}
I1 = {0}

A satisfying example of least length (1) is:
I7              X 0
I0              X 0
I3              X X
I2              X 0
I1              X 0

I7 = {}
I0 = {}
I3 = {}
I2 = {}
I1 = {}
