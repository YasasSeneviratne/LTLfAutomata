ANALYSIS
A counter-example of least length (1) is:
I8              X 0
I3              X 0
I2              X X
I0              X 0

I8 = {}
I3 = {}
I2 = {}
I0 = {}

A satisfying example of least length (1) is:
I8              X 0
I3              X 1
I2              X X
I0              X 0

I8 = {}
I3 = {0}
I2 = {}
I0 = {}
