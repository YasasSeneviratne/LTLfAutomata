ANALYSIS
A counter-example of least length (1) is:
I9              X 0
I0              X X
I4              X 0
I3              X X
I5              X 0
I1              X 0

I9 = {}
I0 = {}
I4 = {}
I3 = {}
I5 = {}
I1 = {}

A satisfying example of least length (1) is:

I3              X X
I5              X 0
I1              X 1

I9 = {}
