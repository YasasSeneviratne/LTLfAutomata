ANALYSIS
A counter-example of least length (1) is:
I7              X 0
I4              X 0
I3              X 1
I9              X X

I7 = {}
I4 = {}
I3 = {0}
I9 = {}

A satisfying example of least length (1) is:
I7              X 0
I4              X 0
I3              X 0
I9              X 0

I7 = {}
I4 = {}
I3 = {}
I9 = {}
