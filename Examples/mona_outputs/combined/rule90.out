ANALYSIS
A counter-example of least length (1) is:
I7              X 0
I0              X 0
I4              X 0
I3              X 0
I5              X 1

I7 = {}
I0 = {}
I4 = {}
I3 = {}
I5 = {0}

A satisfying example of least length (1) is:
I7              X 0
I0              X 0
I4              X 0
I3              X 0
I5              X 0

I7 = {}
I0 = {}
I4 = {}
I3 = {}
I5 = {}
