ANALYSIS
A counter-example of least length (1) is:
I3              X X
I5              X 0
I2              X 0
I1              X 1
I6              X X

I3 = {}
I5 = {}
I2 = {}
I1 = {0}
I6 = {}

A satisfying example of least length (1) is:
I3              X X
I5              X 0
I2              X 0
I1              X 0
I6              X X

I3 = {}
I5 = {}
I2 = {}
I1 = {}
I6 = {}
