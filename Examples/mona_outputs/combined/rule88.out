ANALYSIS
A counter-example of least length (1) is:
I7              X 0
I8              X 0
I5              X 0
I2              X 0
I9              X 1

I7 = {}
I8 = {}
I5 = {}
I2 = {}
I9 = {0}

A satisfying example of least length (1) is:
I7              X 0

I5              X 0
I2              X 0
I9              X 0

I7 = {}
I8 = {}
I5 = {}
I2 = {}
I9 = {}
