ANALYSIS
A counter-example of least length (1) is:
I4              X 0
I3              X 0
I5              X 0
I6              X 1

I4 = {}
I3 = {}
I5 = {}
I6 = {0}

A satisfying example of least length (1) is:
I4              X 0
I3              X 0
I5              X 0
I6              X 0

I4 = {}
I3 = {}
I5 = {}
I6 = {}
