ANALYSIS
A counter-example of least length (1) is:
I1              X 0
I7              X 0
I8              X 0
I9              X 0
I6              X 1

I1 = {}
I7 = {}
I8 = {}
I9 = {}
I6 = {0}

A satisfying example of least length (1) is:
I1              X 0
I7              X 0
I8              X 0
I9              X 0
I6              X 0

I1 = {}
I7 = {}
I8 = {}
I9 = {}
I6 = {}
